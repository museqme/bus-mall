User Stories

Marketing Research Team:
  A 3 person marketing team needs to create a randomized object list in which users can select 1 of 3 images 
  they most desire. 
  Each person on the Marketing team has their own responsibility. One will focus on selecting the products, 
  the other will test the prototype, while the last person collects the final results. 
  
The Developer:
  The developer is tasked with the challenge of:
      randomizing the photos,
      displaying 3 photos at a time,
      never repeating the same photos twice in a row,
      collecting the results of clicked photos. 
      
Focus Group:
  The focus group is responsible for participating in the survey. They will click through their desired products to 
  generate date that the marketing research team can use for their catalog.
